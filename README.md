# Aspect Ratio Calculator 


An Aspect Ratio Calculator is a tool designed to help users quickly and accurately determine the aspect ratio of images, videos, screens, and other rectangular objects. Aspect ratio represents the proportional relationship between the width and height of a rectangle, commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (e.g., 16:9, 4:3). This calculator simplifies the process of maintaining the correct proportions during resizing, ensuring visual content looks its best without distortion.
